# Iris Rainbow


## Overview
Iris Rainbow is an experimental prototype implementation of sentence grouping and compression as an attempt to manage information overload in online based media. 

The goal of Iris Rainbow is to process article data in such a way that it can then be presented in a headline first, outlet choice second fashion, opposed to the current fashion of selecting a news outlet and then selecting a desired headline. Currently the project is purely experimental, with results varying.
